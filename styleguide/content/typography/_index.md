# Typography

Below is the default styling for headings level 1-5 with their default margins. There are no special class names to use. Font sizes will also decrease appropriately on mobile devices but still follow a defined typescale.

# Heading Level 1

## Heading Level 2

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

## The Typescale

Desktop and tablet typescale is based on [major third typescale](https://type-scale.com/?size=16&scale=1.250&text=MDN%20Web%20Docs&font=Poppins&fontweight=400&bodyfont=body_font_default&bodyfontweight=400&lineheight=1.75&backgroundcolor=%23ffffff&fontcolor=%23000000&preview=false) with a base of 100% of base font size set by the user which is typically 16-18px. On mobile phones the typescale is based on a [major second typescale](https://bit.ly/2VUrOJm) with a base of 100% as set by the user.

## ZillaSlab highlight

Any heading level can be set to use the ZillaSlab Highlight style by adding the class `slab-highlight`, for example:

<div class="sample">
    <h2 class="slab-highlight">Slab Highlighted</h2>
</div>

### Code example

```html
<h2 class="slab-highlight">Slab Highlighted</h2>
```
